# EV Charging SQL Analysis

This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station data using SQL. It includes table creation scripts, sample data, and analytical queries to help understand usage patterns and optimize operations.

## Features
- Database schema for EV stations
- Sample data insertions
- Analytical queries (e.g., busiest hours, average usage)
- Notes on SQL performance optimization

## Usage
1. Run `create_tables.sql` to set up the schema.
2. Execute `insert_data.sql` to populate the tables.
3. Use `analysis_queries.sql` to run insights.
